of a sequence of unsigned integers with no specified maximum. Often represented as \
a sequence of numbers separated by periods. \
\
When used in ASN.1 specifications, `OBJECT IDENTIFIER`s are often represented as \
a sequence of arcs enclosed in curly brackets and with a space padding the \
brackets from the arcs. Each arc is either represented in numeric form, or with \
the `ObjectDescriptor` that uniquely defines that arc within its parent arc, or \
the `ObjectDescriptor` followed immediately by the numeric form enclosed in \
parentheses. Example: `{ iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) microsoft(113556) 1 }`. \
\
Each arc of the object identifier is typically associated with an owner, who \
gets to decide what each node beneath their arc means. This owner is free to \
define an infinite number of arcs beneath an arc they own, or delegate \
exclusive ownership and control to another party. To continue off of our \
example, `1.2.840.113556` is the object identifier for Microsoft Corporation, \
and Microsoft Corporation assigned arc 1 within that object identifier to mean \
'Active Directory', and arcs beneath this relate to their Active Directory product.");
