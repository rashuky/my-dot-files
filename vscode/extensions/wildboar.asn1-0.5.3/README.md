## What is ASN.1?

ASN.1 stands for *Abstract Syntax Notation*. ASN.1 was first specified in
[X.680 - Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.680/en),
by the [International Telecommunications Union](https://www.itu.int/en/pages/default.aspx).
ASN.1 messages can be encoded in one of several encoding/decoding standards.
It provides a system of types that are extensible, and can presumably describe
every protocol. You can think of it as a protocol for describing other protocols
as well as a family of standards for encoding and decoding said protocols.
It is similar to Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/),
or Sun Microsystems' [External Data Representation (XDR)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1014).

For more information on what ASN.1 is, see `documentation/asn1.md`.

## Why ASN.1?

ASN.1 is used in, or required by, multiple technologies, including:

* [X.509 Certificates](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509-201610-I/en), used in [SSL/TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246)
* [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt)
* [X.400](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.400/en), the messaging system used by the U.S. Military
* [X.500](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.500-201610-I/en)
* The [magnetic stripes](https://www.iso.org/standard/43317.html) on credit cards and debit cards
* Microsoft's [Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt242409.aspx)
* [Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1157.txt)
* [Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP)](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.711/en)
* [Signalling System Number 7 (SS7)](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.700-199303-I/en),
  used to make most phone calls on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
* [Kerberos 5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4120)
* [H.323](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.323-200912-I/en) Video conferencing
* Biometrics Protocols:
  * [BioAPI Interworking Protocol (BIP)](https://www.iso.org/standard/43611.html)
  * [Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF)](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/IR/nistir6529-a.pdf)
  * [Authentication Contexts for Biometrics (ACBio)](https://www.iso.org/standard/41531.html)
* [Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA)](https://www.ecma-international.org/activities/Communications/TG11/cstaIII.htm)
* [Dedicated Short Range Communications (SAE J2735)](http://standards.sae.org/j2735_200911/)
* Cellular telephony:
  * [Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)](http://www.ttfn.net/techno/smartcards/gsm11-11.pdf)
  * [Global Packet Radio Service (GPRS) / Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE)](http://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/102-gprs-edge)
  * [Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UTMS)](http://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/25-series.htm)
  * [Long-Term Evolution (LTE)](http://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/98-lte)

If you look in the
[`asn1` directory of WireShark's source code](https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/tree/master/epan/dissectors/asn1),
you'll see all of the protocols that use ASN.1.

This list can also be found in `documentation/asn1.d`.

## Building

You can build this library by running `tsc`. The outputs will all be in `dist`.

## Capabilities

- Syntax highlighting
- Bracket matching
- Limited hints, warnings, and errors
- Limited formatting
- Go to definition
- Hover definitions

## Limitations

Unfortunately, I designed this extension poorly from the start, so don't get too creative:

- Validation can't occur across lines.
- Comments inserted in the middle of lines can screw things up.
- Strings are treated just like syntax.

But don't let that scare you. This will work fine for 99% of cases.
